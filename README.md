# AI Gesture Controller with Interactive Screen Overlay

This project is a sophisticated, real-time gesture control application built with Python. It allows you to control your computer, particularly media applications like YouTube, using hand gestures captured through your webcam. It also features a transparent, interactive overlay with drawing and screenshot capabilities.

## ‚ú® Core Features

* **Real-Time Gesture Recognition**: Utilizes Google's MediaPipe to accurately detect hand landmarks and recognize gestures in real-time.
* **System & Media Control**: Control essential functions like play/pause and volume adjustment with simple hand movements.
* **Interactive Overlay UI**: A transparent, always-on-top window built with PyQt5 provides an interface without obstructing your view.
* **On-Screen Drawing**: Activate a drawing mode with a gesture and annotate anything on your screen.
* **Advanced Screenshot Tool**: Capture your entire screen, including any on-screen drawings, and save it to both a file and your clipboard.
* **Instant Visual Feedback**: On-screen notifications confirm which gesture has been recognized and what action has been taken.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

* **Computer Vision**: OpenCV
* **Hand Tracking**: MediaPipe
* **GUI & Overlay**: PyQt5
* **System Automation**: PyAutoGUI
* **Numerical Operations**: NumPy
* **macOS Integration**: AppKit (for clipboard access)

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Platform Compatibility

This application is currently designed and optimized for **macOS**.

Key functionalities, such as system hotkeys (`pyautogui.hotkey('option', 'up')`) and clipboard integration (`AppKit.NSPasteboard`), are specific to the macOS environment. Adapting it for Windows or Linux would require modifying these parts of the code.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* Python 3.7+
* A webcam connected to your computer.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/your-repo-name.git](https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/your-repo-name.git)
    cd your-repo-name
    ```

2.  **Create and activate a virtual environment (recommended):**
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```
    *On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`*

3.  **Install the required dependencies:**
    The project uses several powerful libraries. Install them using the provided `requirements.txt` file (you will need to create this file).
    ```bash
    pip install opencv-python mediapipe pyautogui numpy pyqt5
    ```
    For macOS, `pyobjc` is needed for `AppKit`:
    ```bash
    pip install pyobjc
    ```

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Use

1.  Make sure your webcam is connected and accessible. Your OS may ask for permission to allow the application to access the camera.
2.  Run the main script from your terminal:
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```
3.  Two windows will appear:
    * An **OpenCV window** named 'Gesture Controller' showing the raw camera feed with hand landmarks.
    * A **transparent, full-screen overlay** with control buttons at the top-left.
4.  Position your hand in front of the camera and use the gestures outlined below to control your system.

## üôå Gesture Guide

| Gesture | Action | Feedback |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Fist** | Toggles Play/Pause (sends `space` key) | "Play/Pause" |
| **Thumbs Up** | Increases Volume | "Volume Up" |
| **Thumbs Down** | Decreases Volume | "Volume Down" |
| **Peace Sign** | Enters/Exits Drawing Mode | "Drawing Mode" |

## üé® Overlay Controls

The overlay provides buttons for manual control:

* **Screenshot**: Captures the entire screen, including your drawings. Saves a timestamped `.png` file and copies the image to the clipboard.
* **Draw**: Manually toggles the drawing mode. The button turns green when active.
* **Clear**: Erases all drawings from the overlay.

When in drawing mode, simply click and drag your mouse on the screen to draw.
